# Pluto - Our take on SpotMicro Ai
We have named our SpotMicro: Pluto. Our brain is a Raspberry Pi, and we've used the standard installation from Spotmicro AI as a base.

Right now we have some basic motion tests in this repo.
More information will be added as we continue our journey to a 
more functional Pluto.
